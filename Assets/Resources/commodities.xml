    <Commodity UUID="hull.panels" iconIdx="4" Name="Hull Panels" Description="One of the most important pieces of technology developed during the course of settling the Sirius Sector has been Ship Hull Panels. These wonders of materials research combine a Polymer and Hydrocarbon base along with Basic and Super Alloys to create a substance that is light and flexible, while providing insulation from hard vacuum and all but the most intense radiation. Boron fibers are infused into the panels to endow them with structural rigidity, protecting ships against kinetic impact and high-energy weapons fire." Hull="1" MinimumPrice="40" BasePrice="80"/>
    <Commodity UUID="alien.organisms" iconIdx="31" Name="Alien Organisms" Description="A previously undiscovered bacterial lifeform unique to the Sirius Sector, these microorganisms are remarkably efficient at metabolizing certain elements into oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. When seeded in an immature planetary environment they can accelerate the terraforming process tenfold, or provide a rich, abundant source of food for other organisms in more mature planetary ecosystems." Hull="1" MinimumPrice="50" BasePrice="100"/>
    <Commodity UUID="memetic.gel" iconIdx="32" Name="Bio-Mimetic Gel" Description="A liquid substance used in the study of genetics that is highly regulated. It can be hazardous if not transported correctly. Applications include the creation of biogenic weapons and organic explosives, as well as illegal genetic and cloning experiments." Hull="1" MinimumPrice="800" BasePrice="1000"/>
